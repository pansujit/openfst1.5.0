The OpenFST test has been compiled and in the good condition with a little modification using
Visual Studio 2015 on windows OS.

There has been two problem in "fst_test"
1. fst_test.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol "char const * const fst::arc_lookahead_fst_type"
 (?arc_lookahead_fst_type@fst@@3QBDB)
2. fst_test.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol "public: static class fst::MappedFile * 

 The first one is coming from "extern" constant which is solved by defining the arc_lookhead_fst_type in 
the fst_test.cc and  including the header file that have been declared.
 
 The second problem is coming from the static declaration which also solved by using the same technique as the extern.
 
 The after confgure well visual studio 2015, there is only one problem in the "algotest", is about
 "propertynames".
 This problem is solved by using def file with propertynames  "CONSTANT" inspite of "DATA".
 
 In the visual studio 2015, I need to insert "OPENFSTEXPORT" in prepocessor of c/c++ compiler and also
 in liner explictly define "openfst-gd.lib"(my output libraby name) in the additional dependecies.
 
 All gone Well
 
 Thank you
